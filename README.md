# gh-actions

adasf

Just a repo for testing GH actions using personal account in GH, or using `act` in my local.

`.github/workflows` contain all the examples

`commands.sh` contain a list of commands that you can execute in your computer for testing GH actions locally

`payload.json` is a file for passing variables to `act` in certain examples

__NOTE__: add `-P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:runner-latest` to your `~/.actrc` in order to run actions as non-root
